What to do today:
change my code accordingly. 
syc my codes with new init_db.py and make the changes to the excel file to add the same:


make the add new type working - 26/12
individual delete buttons - select and drag kela tar should be allowed to be deleted 
check export excel
check export keka
check import excel
link the excel docuement to system and viceversa - 26/12

my drop down for add new asset has "add new type" which gives many features or fields, 
i select them and the same gets populated as a form and then when i enter save, it should
get stored in db with its respective features, thus reflect the same on dashboard and when 
i am viewing the same
