What to do today:
change my code accordingly. 
syc my codes with new init_db.py and make the changes to the excel file to add the same:


make the add new type working - 26/12 (failed)
individual delete buttons - select and drag kela tar should be allowed to be deleted - perfect
check export excel - perfect
    currency format
    date format 
check export keka - perfect
check import excel - perfect
link the excel document to system and viceversa - 26/12 (failed)

what all fields can change? according to me, object id, category, Serial No., IMEI-1, IT Tag, IT Tag (CPU), IT Tag (MTR),  Accounts tag, 
Accounts Tag (CPU),  Accounts Tag (MTR), created at and updated at, leaving that aside, everything else can change, out of which just these, 
after giving go ahead to all kinds of changes (whether date or currency or anything else), only these 5 will get appended to remarks 
(Status - Employee code - Employee name - Area - Given Date) because it creates a user history whenever any modifications are there to it
