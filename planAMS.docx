What to do today:
change my code accordingly.

I did not get it, but tell me firstly i only had create and edit that played with the excel data, further import and export dealt with the same a little, 
the new chnages that we are talkign about, they need to be compatible with the ones already existing. i wanted excel and AMS 
bidirectional syncing where AMS > excel, meaning all the chnages made in AMS will be reflected in excel, and whatever chnages made in excel 
will be checked and verified by AMS before updating or adding to the asset in AMS, am i right till here? 

make the add new type working - 26/12 (failed), 02/01 - plan to do the same
individual delete buttons - select and drag kela tar should be allowed to be deleted - perfect
check export excel - perfect
    currency format
    date format 
check export keka - perfect
check import excel - perfect
link the excel document to system and viceversa - 26/12 (failed), 02/01/26 - currently doing it

what all fields can change? according to me, object id, category, Serial No., IMEI-1, IT Tag, IT Tag (CPU), IT Tag (MTR),  Accounts tag, 
Accounts Tag (CPU),  Accounts Tag (MTR), created at and updated at, leaving that aside, everything else can change, out of which just these, 
after giving go ahead to all kinds of changes (whether date or currency or anything else), only these 5 will get appended to remarks 
(Status - Employee code - Employee name - Area - Given Date) because it creates a user history whenever any modifications are there to it 

WAIT.
excel has many users, some can make mistakes, like deleting the asset,
when i import the same in AMS then it will detect the missing asset, it will soft delete the same (because what if i want to reverse it) and if i really want to delete it for real, i can delete it via mongo db.
now in case of deletion which is done directly in AMS, it directly removes the same from everywhere including mongoDB.

Asset name and asset type under that, it should have the name of the asset/category, that is if it is Mobile, then it should show so
asset id is a little complex, different for every asset/category, that is under Asset id:
for Mobile : imei1 or imei2 or both if it exists separated by commas, if one exists and the other doesn’t, no trailing commas should be left behind
for Barcode Scanner: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Face Machine: serial_no
for Franchise TAB: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Franchise Printer: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Franchise Inv: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Laptop: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for IP Phones: serial_no
for Printer: it_tag or accounts_tag or serial_no, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Desktop: IT_tagC, accounts_tagC, serial_no, IT_tagM, accounts_tagM,  whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for All-in-one: it_tag
for Mouse: serial_no
for KBD: serial_no
for HDD: serial_no
for Battery: serial_no
for Headphones:serial_no

under asset description for all assets, it also differs:
for Mobile : model, ram, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Barcode Scanner:model
for Face Machine: model
for Franchise TAB: model
for Franchise Printer:model
for Franchise Inv:system_model, system_manufacturer, os, processor, ram, hdd, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas  
for Laptop:system_model, system_manufacturer, os, processor, ram, hdd, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas 
for IP Phones: model
for Printer:model, ip address, domain, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Desktop: system_model, system_manufacturer, main_circuit_board, os,processor, ram, hdd and  monitor_make, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for All-in-one: system_model, system_manufacturer, main_circuit_board, os,processor, ram, hdd and  ip_address, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Mouse: model
for KBD:model
for HDD: model and hdd_type, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Battery: model and battery type, whatever is available, separated commas if more than one exists, and no trailing commas
for Headphones:model

//////VERY IMP 
There are three names for the same field floating around:

Excel header (what the user sees)

Schema label (what asset_types_collection stores)

DB field key (what MongoDB stores)

Issue #3 is about making sure DB keys always win, and the other two are just helpers.

You are mostly correct already — I just wanted to make sure you understand the rule, not force a change.

🧠 The 3-name problem (real example)

Let’s take GST.

In Excel
GST (18%)

In asset_types_collection
{
  "label": "GST (18%)",
  "name": "gst_18"
}

In MongoDB (actual stored key)
"gst_18": 118.00


So:

Layer	Value
Excel header	GST (18%)
Schema label	GST (18%)
DB key	gst_18
🔧 What your code currently does (step-by-step)

In confirm_import you do:

field_key = header_to_field_key(h)
if field_key == h:
    field_key = schema_key

Case 1: Header = GST (18%)
header_to_field_key("GST (18%)") → "gst_18"


✔ Correct
✔ DB key used
✔ Schema fallback NOT needed

Case 2: Header = Amount
header_to_field_key("Amount") → "amount"


Schema key = "amount"

✔ Still correct
✔ DB key used

Case 3: Header = something odd (user edited Excel)
"GST18"

header_to_field_key("GST18") → "gst18"   # not ideal
field_key == h → False


Then fallback kicks in:

field_key = schema_key  # gst_18


✔ DB stays clean
✔ User mistake doesn’t pollute Mongo

✅ So what was the “issue”?

There is NO bug right now.

Issue #3 was simply this rule you must always follow:

MongoDB must ONLY contain canonical field keys
(like gst_18, amount, serial_no)
NEVER Excel labels.

Your code already enforces this indirectly via:

header_to_field_key

schema fallback

normalize_gst_keys

So:

🔥 Do you need to change anything now?

NO.

🔒 What you need to remember for future changes

Never save Excel headers directly

Never save schema labels directly

Always resolve → DB key

That’s it.

🧭 Final status after your clarifications
Issue	Status
Two Excel exports	✅ Correct design
Dead code	✅ You’ll remove
Issue #3	✅ Understood, no change needed
